                        source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for
                        debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and
                        embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install
                        extensions that add additional functionality.

                        Microsoft has released Visual Studio Code's source code on the microsoft/vscode (Code - OSS)
                        repository of GitHub, under the permissive MIT License, while the releases by Microsoft are
                        freeware.

                        In the Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular
                        developer environment tool, with 50.7% of 87,317 respondents reporting that they use it.

                        Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build
                        conference. A Preview build was released shortly thereafter.

                        On November 18, 2015, Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License, having its source
                        code available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced. On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio
                        Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the Web.</p>

                    <p style="Padding: 0px 25px 25px 25px; font-family: poiret one;">Visual Studio Code is a source-code
                        editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go,
                        Node.js, Python and C++. It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js
                        Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor
                        component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and
                        Visual Studio Team Services).nstead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more
                        directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. This allows it to operate
                        as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. It supports a number of programming
                        languages and a set of features that differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be
                        excluded from the project tree via the settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not
                        exposed through menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette.Visual
                        Studio Code can be extended via extensions, available through a central repository. This
                        includes additions to the editor. and language support. A notable feature is the ability to
                        create extensions that add support for new languages, themes, and debuggers, perform static code
                        analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol.
                        Visual Studio Code includes multiple extensions for FTP, allowing the software to be used as a
                        free alternative for web development. Code can be synced between the editor and the server,
                        without downloading any extra software.
                        Visual Studio Code allows users to set the code page in which the active document is saved, the
                        newline character, and the programming language of the active document. This allows it to be
                        used on any platform, in any locale, and for any given programming language.</p>
